# Data Analysis of the Indian Premier League
This is a repository containing files associated with a project done under Winter in Data Science (WiDS) program by Analytics Club, Indian Institue of Technology, Bombay.

For this projrct, I started with the following datasets - [Datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/nowke9/ipldata?select=matches.csv)

I performed the necessary data preprocessing to make the data clean and easy to work with. Then I performed Exploratory Data Analysis to extract some useful insights from the datasets.

The next task was to predict the winner and the final score. For the same I trained various ML models on this data and compared their accuracy.

For predicting the final score, I trained a neural network as well.
